# Open Source Softwares

Open source software (OSS) refers to software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. It promotes transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development. OSS is often free to use and can be customized to suit individual needs. Examples include Linux, Mozilla Firefox, and Blender. Additionally, OSS powers various applications such as Moodle for e-learning, Kdenlive for video editing, and WordPress for website creation, enabling users to work efficiently with these tools.
